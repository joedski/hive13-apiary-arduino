Arduino Code for the HIVE13 Apiary Box
======================================

Arduino code for the Hive13 Apiary potpourri box.

This is a ground-up rewrite of the 2014 code because that seems to be missing.  This time, it shall be put on Github for posterity and so people can publicly mock the code.



Libraries
---------

This uses the following libraries:

- [PWMServo][pwmservo] This restricts servos to pins 9 and 10, so should probably be replaced at some point, and is old anyway.
- [Adafruit NeoPixel][neopixel]
